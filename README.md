# dir-sync
Node.js Script to keep synchronization of files between two directories
Useful when you have working directory on 2 devices i.e. PC and pendrive and need to keep most recent files on both of them, but you don't remember which files you added/cachnged recently on which drive.

Currently works only for 2 directories
## How to run
  ```node App.js /path/to/dir1 /path/to/dir2```
